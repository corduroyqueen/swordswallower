“want to jump so bad”
feels like it should have jump
frontload the checkpoints
more indicators to use a checkpoint
making checkpoints make sense in world
more tutorialization
is it strategic or is it fast paced


minimap
zoom in for boss battles


2

claymation game
always throw the sword to activate ckpt
learn letting go separate from hitting walls separate from clinging
boss - if you go too early he recognizes


3
checkpoints on map kind of a lot
practice area without spikes perhaps
killing flies and pods should be different
some hallways are a little narrow
boss 2 is a bit cramped
forgot that yellow markers are checkpoints
teach perma checkpoint return earlier

4
forgetting to use checkpoints

blake
jiggly zone 
doesnt like the checkpoints cuz you have to go back and get it
want to normal checkpoits or perma checkpoints
should be perma checkpoint after the boss
should hold last position of the sword when you reset
should resting even be in the game? quedtionable
too planny
better without a jump
different cursor for sure
visual on going through walls so its clear whats happening
maybe goes into foreground?


glitch: flew up from ground
glitch: fell through floor in small box at end
